# ImmuneAgingAnalysis

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy in some cases elicits striking patient responses, but its efficacy appears to be dependent on several incompletely understood factors, including immune checkpoint gene expression and the makeup of the immune tumor microenvironment (ITME). Most studies of ICB therapies in elderly patients have concluded that they received no reduced benefit or even increased benefit compared to the younger patients analyzed, despite the systemic age-related immune changes that might be expected to produce a less favorable ITME for therapeutic response, such as loss of the capacity to generate new naive T cells. However, the ITME of elderly patients has received little specific study. In order to investigate the phenomenon of ICB efficacy in older patients and understand the effects of age on the ITME, we apply bioinformatics methods to transcriptomics and clinical data, the code for which is deposited here.
